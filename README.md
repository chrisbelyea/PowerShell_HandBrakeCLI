The Vagrantfile supports the [`vagrant-cachier`](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-cachier) plugin to cache APT repositories for faster startup. It is not required but can reduce  ```vagrant up``` times during subsequent runs.

## How to use

Clone this repository, and ```cd``` to the repo directory. Then run ```vagrant up``` to get started. Once provisioning is complete, point your browser to http://localhost:8080.
